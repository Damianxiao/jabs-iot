JABS - Just Another Blockchain Simulator.

JABS is a blockchain network simulator aimed at researching consensus algorithms for performance ans security evaluation.
JABS is designed to easily handel simulation of networks as large as blockchain networks (~10000 nodes) close to real time.
  

## Usage
Currently, you can use JABS by editing Main.java file and creating new scenarios for your tests.


### Supported Consensus algorithms
Following Consensus algorithms are supported by JABS: 
 1. Nakamoto Consensus
 2. Ghost protocol
 3. PBFT
 4. Casper FFG
 6. DAGsper
